# RPI_AMP

## Introduction  
This is an open source real time embedded project based on raspberry 3 and progarmmed with C++.The aim of the project is that providing an intelligent,portable and extensible RPI_AMP,especiall for music-lovers.In our project ,we designed four different functions and users could choose any one on the GUI. Meanwhile, users could change the degree of the effect based on the knobs.

## Function
### Func1:Distortion
This function can process the input music amplitude to achieve distortion. Its core algorithm is to allow a specific range of amplitudes to pass and the knob could change the range based on the requirments of user.
### Func2:Delay
Delay is an audio effect and an effects unit which records an input signal to an audio storage medium, and then plays it back after a period of time.

### Func3:Reverb
### Func4:EQ

## Future work
There are plenty of things that can be done to improve RPI_AMP, which could be divided into two parts ,namely,hardware and software. 
1) The major limitation is the data processing of the Raspberry pi is slower, which affects the sound quality.The optimization of the program can effectively solve this problem, but it requires programming skills and rich experience on C++. 
2) For hardware
